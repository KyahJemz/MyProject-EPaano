(1, 'Should You Use Facebook and Google to Log in Other', 'post_image1.jpg', 'technology', 5, 'By Talon Homer', 1, 'When you\'re considering creating a new account for a website, chances are you\'ll be given an option to use your existing Facebook, Google or other account as a sign-in. This method is commonly known as single sign-on (SSO). Facebook and Google connectivity are the most common offers but some services add Apple, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts as well.<br><br>\nThe question is, should you use one of those existing accounts to log in to this new website, or go to the trouble of creating a new account with your email address?<br><br>\nThe single sign-on method can get you signed up for a new service really quickly. However, it does give you less control over what information is shared when the account is activated. Your social media credentials will likely share things like your email address, name, and profile photo to the app, and it may be able to access more personal details like your birthdate and phone number. What does or doesn\'t get shared ultimately comes down to the policies of both the preexisting account, and the one being signed up for. The app should also provide text making clear what is shared during the signup process.<br><br>\nTo iron out all the details, we\'ve enlisted the help of cybersecurity experts Paul Bischoff and Dan Fritcher to give insight on how this SSO technology works. We\'ll also outline how Google, Facebook, Apple, and Twitter handle third parties accessing your data through them.<br>\n\n<h2>The Pros of Single Sign-On</h2><br>\nThe main selling point of SSO is simply saved time and convenience. It skips the lengthy registration process of filling out forms and fields, since that information can likely be pulled from your social media account. It also cuts down on the hassle that comes with keeping track of usernames and passwords, and which ones match up with which. After the umpteenth account registration, that can seem like a nearly impossible task. Your preexisting account acts as a key that can be used to access a wide variety of services. While the third party is able to collect data from this transaction, they will not be able to see your social media password.<br>\nSome apps can also use a linked account to import useful files. For instance, Dropbox allows photos to be directly imported from Facebook to cloud storage. Productivity suites like Zoom and Slack can also be synced with Google calendar. However, you don\'t necessarily have to use single sign-on to take advantage of these functions.<br><br>\n\n<h2>The Cons of Single Sign-On</h2><br>\nThe disadvantages of SSO all come down to personal preferences and security. This method limits the choice of what gets shared during registration. As mentioned earlier, the app may be allowed to scrape names, photos and contact info, although you may have entered many of those things during signup, regardless of which method you use. In some cases, the new app gains access to more personal info like your age, location or interests. These details then may be used to serve you personalized ads, or sold to data collection companies.<br>\n\"Using a social login creates a network of sites that hold a shared identifier on you. That identifier can be used to create a shared advertising profile based on your activity on each of the sites,\" emails Dan Fritcher, chief technology officer of Sysfi cloud services. \"Over time, that profile grows larger and larger. For most people, it won\'t matter much, but the risk is we have no idea what it will be used for in the future.\"<br>\nUltimately, you should be aware of what data each account will share and decide whether or not you\'re comfortable with granting access. For instance, a site that hasn\'t built up its own trusted reputation may be more likely to take your contact info and sell it to scammers for a quick buck. Trustworthy sites will have accessible documentation charting out what data they collect, and exactly how it\'s intended to be used, commonly known as a privacy policy.<br>\nSSO may also present more cybersecurity risks than regular registration. If a hacker is able to get hold of your social media login through phishing or a password leak, then they could also have free reign over other accounts you registered using that info. The account may also be locked, blocking access to sites that used single sign-on. Furthermore, If Facebook or Google experiences a service outage, that can temporarily crash that service\'s SSO function across the board. With that said, here\'s a look at the data sharing policies of the companies most likely to offer SSO.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Facebook\'s Data Sharing Policy</h2><br>\nLike other services, Facebook will provide your name, email address, and profile photo when a single sign-on is initiated. However, Facebook can also give the third party access to information it labels under the \"public profile\" umbrella. This essentially covers anything that is made available on your profile page, including more personal details like your age, gender, birthdate, relationship status, family details, hobbies and devices used. It may even serve up things such as your hometown, work and education history, religion and political leanings.<br>\nThe data that Facebook collects is extensive, and it\'s more than willing to share that data with third parties, as recent scandals and lawsuits have shown. However, some of this info can be flagged as non-public using Facebook\'s privacy options.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Google\'s Policy</h2><br>\nAt a minimum, Google will share your name, email address and profile photo with the third party during single sign-on. Some apps may also attempt to retrieve files, photos, messages, or calendar events stored on your Google Drive. However, they will have to specifically request those permissions to be granted access.<br><br>\n\n<h2>What to Do About SSO</h2><br>\nIf you plan on using single sign-on, be aware what info gets carried over. If you are offered a choice of companies, go with the service that will share the least amount of data. Based on what information is shared, and what users have control over, Apple appears to be one of the best services to use when it comes to SSO. You can create an Apple account even if you don\'t have any Apple devices.<br>\nOr you could opt for Twitter as Bischoff prefers. \"Compared to other networks where I store a lot of private information and data, almost everything related to my Twitter account is public, so there\'s not much more data an app can glean from you logging in with Twitter,\" he says. However, not every app will have every sign-on option available.<br>\nYou should also beef up your social media security by enabling two factor authentication, which generates a temporary passcode to be sent to your personal email or phone number. This is one of the quickest and most effective methods to prevent unwanted online access, and it will have the added benefit of protecting your single sign-on accounts as well. The most secure practice is to create unique passwords for every service you use, and an encrypted password manager will be useful in keeping track of all of them.<br>\n\n\n\n', 'post_cover1.png'),

(3, 'Basic Health and Care Advice for Your Cat', 'post_image3.jpg', 'animals', 5, 'By Stacy Hackett', 1, 'How often do you take your cat to the veterinarian? In observance of National Cat Health Month, we want to remind you that even if your cat does not appear to be sick, preventative care is important.<br><br>\nBetween visits to your cat\'s veterinarian, here are 10 ways to keep your cat healthy.<br>\n\n<h2>1. Groom your cat regularly.</h2><br>\nWhether your cat has short or long fur, he will benefit greatly from regular brushing or combing. This helps remove the dead hair from his coat so he doesn\'t ingest it while self-grooming. It also gives you the chance to notice any changes to his body. Irregularities such as lumps, bumps or sore spots can then be investigated right away by your veterinarian.<br><br>\n\n<h2>2. Provide fresh water daily.</h2><br>\nClean, fresh water is essential for your cat\'s good health. If your cat doesn\'t seem to drink from a bowl, consider providing her with a tall glass (some cats don\'t like to bend down to drink) or a cat fountain. Be sure to replenish the water with a fresh supply every day.<br><br>\n\n<h2>3. Make sure you have enough litter boxes.</h2><br>\nA general rule of thumb for litter boxes is one for each cat plus one more. So if you have 2 cats, you should have 3 litter boxes. To encourage good litter box habits, keep the litter boxes clean. This may mean scooping more than once per day. Regular cleaning will also help you notice any changes in your cat\'s urine or stool, which could indicate a health issue.<br><br>\n\n<h2>4. Notice if your cat starts urinating outside its litter box.</h2><br>\nSometimes a cat will urinate outside his litter box if the box is dirty. But before you blame the accident on the state of the litter box or your cat\'s naughty behavior, schedule a visit to the veterinarian. A change in litter box habits sometimes means that a cat has a urinary tract infection or other medical issue.<br><br>\n\n<h2>5. Train your cat to use a scratching post.</h2><br>\nNot only will this help prevent damage to your furniture, it will help your cat stretch her muscles and keep her claws in top condition. Regular scratching on an appropriate surface such as carpet, sisal, or cardboard helps remove the old layers from your cat\'s claws.<br><br>\n\n<h2>6. Use a cat carrier in the car.</h2><br>\nDoes your cat need to visit the vet? Or are you moving to a new home? Transport your cat in an appropriate carrier designed for pets. Allowing your cat to roam freely in the car can distract you from driving safely, which can lead to accidents that may harm both you and your cat.<br><br>\n\n<h2>7. Keep your cat\'s teeth clean.</h2><br>\nLike humans, cats can develop tartar on their teeth, which can lead to gum disease and tooth decay. The bacteria that collect on your cat\'s teeth also can enter her bloodstream, contributing to other feline diseases. Unlike humans, however, cats can\'t brush their teeth. And many cats won\'t let their owners brush their teeth for them. To keep your cat\'s teeth in top condition, schedule a cleaning with your veterinarian at least once every year.<br><br>\n\n<h2>8. Choose a cat-friendly vet.</h2><br>\nIt seems to go without saying that cats are not smaller versions of dogs. That said, it follows that cats have different veterinary requirements than dogs do. A veterinarian specializing in feline health and anatomy can be a valuable ally in keeping your cat in her best possible health. You can find a feline vet in your area by visiting the American Association of Feline Practitioners.<br><br>\n\n<h2>9. Schedule regular veterinary visits.</h2><br>\nAnnual visits give the vet a chance to catch any potential feline diseases in their early stages, administer vaccines, and clean the cat\'s teeth. Your vet can also tell you if your cat is at a healthy weight.<br><br>\n\n<h2>10. Spay or neuter your cat.</h2><br>\nReproductive diseases can affect cats of both genders, both male and female. Spaying prevents uterine infections, ovarian cancers and breast tumors in female cats, while neutering prevents testicular cancer and some prostate problems in males. The surgeries also reduce a male cat\'s urge to roam and if done soon enough in his life, may eliminate his urge to spray to mark territory. The best benefit? Your cat won\'t contribute to the pet overpopulation situation.<br><br>', 'post_cover3.png'),
(4, 'Morning vs. Evening Showers: Discuss.', 'post_image4.jpg', 'lifestyle, health', 4, 'By Alia Hoyt', 1, 'Not since we begged the question of whether it\'s a good idea to brush teeth in the shower has a hygiene-related topic had the potential to generate such debate. An informal poll found wide-ranging opinions on the day versus evening shower -- some people can\'t get through the day without starting it with a good scrub down, whereas others simply can\'t settle in for the night unless they\'re squeaky clean. Then there are those who prefer to go with the flow based on schedule and exercise habits.<br><br> All the conflicting opinions causes us to wonder whether one time of day is superior to another for the purpose of showering? Often, the answer to such a seemingly innocuous question isn\'t as simple as one would think. Let\'s look at it from a few different angles.<br><br>  <h2>The Sleep Factor</h2><br> Although many people prefer a morning shower to help them wake up, the evening shower is actually a valuable tool for winding down at night, particularly for those with sleep problems. \"If we are looking at showering strictly from a sleep perspective, there is no question that someone should be showering at night vs. in the morning,\" explains Bill Fish, certified sleep science coach with Tuck.com, noting that the human body thrives on structure and routine.<br><br> Indeed, research has shown that a soothing, warm bath or shower before bedtime raises the body temperature enough to set the tone for a good night\'s rest. Raising your body temperature and then allowing it to cool seems to hasten sleep. \"If you make it a point to shower roughly 30 minutes prior to going to sleep each night, your body will begin to know that the sleep ritual has begun and you will begin to naturally feel sleepy after your nightly shower,\" he adds.<br><br> Laurelei Litke, a digital marketing content expert at HealthLabs.com in Houston, swears by this recommendation. \"As an insomniac, having a nightly routine is so important,\" she says in an email. \"I like to take a warm shower about an hour before bedtime, but I leave my room pretty cold. Controlling my body temperature is a big part of falling asleep for me!\"<br><br> On the other hand, a regular morning shower could be a must for people who need an extra jolt to get going. \"Research shows that there is a positive aspect of water in improving our ability to become awake faster. Showering in the morning is refreshing and makes us feel clean and ready for the day — something to pay attention to if we want to boost our confidence,\" says psychiatrist Dr. Damian Jacob Sendler via email.<br><br> <b>The Verdict:</b>Evening showers are best for people with sleep problems, but if you sleep well and need it to feel alert in the morning there\'s no harm in showering when you rise.<br>  <h2>Skin Sense</h2><br> Dermatologically speaking, there\'s not much difference between morning and nighttime showers. \"It does not matter whether you shower in the morning or at night as far as the skin is concerned,\" explains Dr. Anna D. Guanche with the Bella Skin Institute in an email, although she does note, \"If you have difficulty sleeping, a warm shower or bath could help you fall asleep, and good sleep is great for your skin.\"<br><br> Overall skin health aside, some people prefer to wash the grime and allergens of the day away before hitting the hay. \"I hate going into bed dirty,\" emails Tonia Luk, a stay-at-home mom who lives in a Rockville, Maryland.<br><br> Spring Hill, Tennessee-based Peri Krichbaum concurs with Luk, although her evening showers actually started for a different reason. \"I started doing that when my allergies got bad,\" she emails. This is actually a great strategy for people who suffer from allergies and asthma, as pre-bedtime showering removes pollen and other allergens from the hair and skin. What started out as necessity soon became habit for Krichbaum, however. \"Now I need to shower at night to go to wash off the day and go to bed clean,\" she says.<br><br> However, early morning exercisers often smartly shower before heading off to work. The feeling – not to mention smell – of dried sweat is anything but comfortable!<br><br> <b>The Verdict:</b>Evening showers are ideal for people with asthma and allergies. Otherwise, shower whenever you feel like it because your skin won\'t know the difference.<br>  <h2>The Hairy Situation</h2><br> Once again, the morning versus night debate must take into account specific characteristics of the individual\'s hair. People with fine and/or oily hair are generally advised to wash up in the morning, otherwise hair will appear flat, dull and possibly greasy. Jenny Dell, a fundraising expert in Thomasville, Georgia has a full head of very fine hair. \"If I sleep on fresh fluffy hair for even a few hours, I wake up looking like a wet cat,\" she explains in an email, adding that the morning shower is non-negotiable for her.<br><br> On the other hand, people with thick hair can really choose either time, depending on the style they seek, but many do opt to shower at night in order to skip the heated tools, which can damage hair if used too often. Or else, their hair may be naturally on the dry side and doesn\'t need to be shampooed more than once a week.<br><br> If you wash your hair at night, make sure it is totally dry before turning in, because the prolonged moisture can cause microbes to build, potentially resulting in dandruff or other scalp irritations.<br><br> <b>The Verdict:</b>People with fine hair should shower in the morning. Otherwise, do whatever suits your schedule and style.<br><br>', 'post_cover4.jpg'),
(5, 'Things to Consider Before Buying Your First Home.', 'post_image5.jpg', 'money, lifestyle', 5, 'By  Karen Kirkpatrick', 1, 'You\'ve landed your dream job and dreamier spouse/partner/whatever. Suddenly, you find yourself thinking about putting down roots, moving out of your noisy apartment and buying a house. Slow down just a bit. It\'s a huge step. Taking on a house usually means an increase in your monthly outlay for mortgage, utilities and maintenance, plus a time commitment for keeping the yard in shape.<br><br> Still, it\'s the American dream -- to go along with the job and spouse. Before you find yourself mired in a nightmare, read through our list of things to keep in mind to help make the dream that much sweeter.<br><br> <h2>Contents</h2> <ol type=\"1\"> 	<li>Roots</li> 	<li>The Process</li> 	<li>Type of House</li> 	<li>Affordability</li> 	<li>Credit Score</li> 	<li>Down Payment</li> 	<li>Job</li> 	<li>Home Repairs and Maintenance</li> 	<li>Children</li> 	<li>The Market</li> </ol> <br><br> <h2>Roots</h2><br> Are you up for a promotion that would send you halfway across the country? Have always wanted to live in a grass hut on the beach halfway around the world? If either of these is the case in your life, now may not be the time to buy.<br><br> You\'ll want to examine things like the market in your area. Are home values rising, and how quickly? You may pay closing costs when you buy the house, and perhaps be asked to pay them again when you sell it. And the thing about home mortgages: Most of your monthly payments for the first few years cover the interest. You don\'t make much headway on the principal for a while, which means you aren\'t building up equity.<br><br> The bottom line is this: Even if you live in a buyer\'s market now, you may not be able to make much money if you try to sell your house within the first few years. On the other hand, if everyone from your great-grandparents on down has lived in the same neighborhood and you aren\'t about to break with tradition, now may be a great time to buy a house. Look for a home that can grow with your family – or at least accommodate all the family members in the neighborhood who will be dropping by.<br><br>  <h2>The Process</h2><br> Buying a house is not like buying groceries -- or even a car. It can be a complicated process involving a lot of paperwork that often makes little sense. Here are some of the general steps (specifics vary by state) that you will need to take as you prepare to sign on the dotted line.<br><br> <b>Before you look:</b> <ul type=\"circle\"> 	<li>Save your money. You\'ll need it for a down payment, a home inspection, closing costs, some repairs or upgrades to your new home and monthly mortgage payments.</li> 	<li>Get prequalified for a loan to learn how much house you can afford. This keeps you from looking at houses that are out of your price range and also lets sellers know you\'re serious and can afford their home.</li> 	</ul><br> <b>Once you\'re under contract:</b> <ul type=\"circle\"> 	<li>Apply for a loan. Just because you\'re preapproved for a specific amount doesn\'t mean you\'re approved for a loan. Your lender can help you understand the loan process, including the documents you\'ll have to provide and the loan costs involved.</li> 	<li>Have the house inspected. A professional inspector can uncover problems that you may not find otherwise.</li> 	<li>Gather your funds for closing. You may have to have certified funds (a bank check -- not a personal one) for the down payment and closing costs.</li> </ul><br><br> Buying a home can be a stressful undertaking. The best plan is to work with a real estate agent who understands the market in your area and will help you find the affordable home of your dreams.<br><br>  <h2>Type of House</h2><br> Do you have visions of living in a traditional home in the suburbs, one with a big yard and a houseful of kids and pets? Maybe your spouse likes the idea of in-town living, a condo within walking distance of shops and restaurants. What about two or more stories vs. a single-level home? Do you envision a basement or garage where you could have a workshop or space for a home office?<br><br> You may not be able to afford everything on your wish list, but it\'s important to talk with both your partner and your real estate agent about the things that might be deal breakers for you.<br><br>  <h2>Affordability</h2><br> Just because you\'ve been preapproved for a certain amount doesn\'t mean you have to max out that loan with your first home. In fact, you may not want to spend every penny on your home loan every month. When considering how much house you can afford, here are some other costs to be aware of:<br><br> <ul type=\"circle\">   <li>Mortgage payments are the monthly payments you make to the bank to pay back your loan. Often these payments include not just the principal and interest on the loan, but also property taxes and homeowners insurance. If your lender does not collect and pay out your taxes and insurance, you\'ll be responsible for them yourself.</li>   <li>Closing costs, which are paid at the loan closing, might include lender and attorney fees, flood or title insurance, and any up-front interest on your loan -- called points.</li>   <li>Your new neighborhood may have a homeowners association with required monthly or annual dues.</li> </ul><br> Keep all of these expenses in mind as you\'re shopping for a new home, and talk to your real estate agent and lender about any other unexpected expenses to expect.<br><br>  <h2>Credit</h2><br> Before you begin shopping for a house, get a copy of your credit report. Your credit score will play a large part in determining the interest rate you are able to get on your loan. The FICO credit score is the most widely used and ranges from 300 to 850 [source: Bankrate Credit].<br><br> Credit scores are affected by such things as the number of credit cards you have, outstanding balances, student and car loans and whether you pay your bills on time. The higher your credit score, the more likely you\'ll be able to get a loan to buy a house at a lower interest rate.<br><br> It is not unusual for there to be mistakes on a credit report -- often mistakes that bring your credit score down. Review it carefully and correct any mistakes you find before you apply for a home loan.<br><br>  <h2>Down Payment</h2><br> The down payment, which is the money you pay up front for your home, can vary from 0 to 20 percent or more depending on the loan type and your credit rating. Do your research and talk to lenders in your area about how much you will have to put down.  Credit unions and several government-backed programs -- including the Veterans Administration (VA) and the Federal Housing Administration (FAH) -- offer low-down-payment loans. Most conventional loans -- not government sponsored -- require more down.<br><br> Many first-time homebuyers have trouble saving enough for the down payment. The lucky ones have family who will give them money to help with it. Before you get too excited, talk the gift over with your lender, who will want to be sure the money is in fact an outright gift and not a loan dressed up like a gift.<br><br> Lenders check your bank statements, credit history, pay stubs and income tax returns before they decide to loan you money. If you have a large sum suddenly appear in an account, they are going to want to know where you got it. If it is a gift with no strings attached, you may be asked to provide a gift letter from the giver, with the name, date of gift and statement that it is a gift with no repayment expected.<br><br>  <h2>Job</h2><br> There are a couple of things related to your job that are important when you\'re thinking of buying a house. First, how stable is it? Have you had your job for at least a year? Do you see yourself staying with the job for the next few years? These are things a lender will look at and talk to you about before making a loan.<br><br> The second thing to consider is your commute. Does it matter to you how long it is? Does it matter to your partner? If you choose a house close to work and then either lose your job or take a job in a different area, is that still a place you\'d be happy to live? Maybe you work from home. If so, do you need dedicated space for equipment, computers or a phone? There are no right or wrong answers to these kinds of questions. Just think seriously about them, and talk to your housemate about them as well, to find the right answers for your situation.<br><br>  <h2>Home Repairs and Maintenance</h2><br> Some of the hidden costs of home ownership are in repairs and maintenance. When thinking about how much house you can afford, consider these costs before you commit to a monthly payment that will take your entire budget. What happens if the air conditioning needs to be replaced, the roof leaks or the refrigerator dies? Consider putting money aside every month to cover those home emergencies, which will crop up more often than you think.<br><br> If you\'re handy, you might consider buying a house that needs some work. You can probably get it for much less than a perfect home, and then you can put in what\'s commonly called \"sweat equity.\" Later, when you have the home of your dreams, it may be worth much more than you paid for it. Talk to your real estate agent about whether or not home values are rising in your area. You don\'t want to buy a fixer-upper that\'s in a neighborhood on the decline.<br><br>  <h2>Children</h2><br> Do you have or are you planning to have children? If so, you\'ll want to consider the school district and neighborhood before buying. In fact, even if you don\'t have children, it\'s smart to consider the school district.<br><br> According to a survey, 20 percent of buyers said they would pay 6 to 10 percent over their budget for a home in the right school district [source: DeBord]. Of course, this means as a buyer that you may have to pay more for a home in a good school district. On the other hand, when you go to sell that home, you\'re likely to make more on the sale than if it were in a less desirable district.<br><br> Even if a school district is a major consideration when buying a home, don\'t forget about other factors that can be important if you have or plan to have children. Take a look at the neighborhood. Is it family friendly? Does the street have a lot of traffic? Is there a playground? A swimming pool? Are there sidewalks? What about other kids? Keep all of this in mind if you\'re planning to raise a family in your new home.<br><br>  <h2>The Market</h2><br> Since the advent of the Great Recession in 2008, the real estate market has bounced back and forth between a buyer\'s and a seller\'s market in many areas. Have you ever wondered what those terms really mean?<br><br> A buyer\'s market is when there are more houses for sale than there are buyers for them. That happened early in the recession when, after the boom in new home sales, suddenly there were more new homes than builders could sell. The buyer\'s market continued as the recession lingered, people lost their jobs, foreclosures peaked and housing prices tanked.<br><br> The opposite, a seller\'s market, occurs when fewer houses are on the market than there are buyers. The run up to the recession was a booming seller\'s market in most areas of the U.S. With several buyers often bidding for the same house, home prices kept reaching new heights.<br><br> Talk to a real estate agent in your area who can help you understand the market and how it\'s currently impacting buyers.<br><br>', 'post_cover5.jpg'),

One popular plyometric exercise is jumping off a box and rebounding off the floor and onto another, higher box. Box jumps will also provide practice for jumping.</li>   <li><b>Full Squats</b> This barbell exercise will build both strength and power. It\'s also one of the best total body exercises you can do.</li>   <li><b>Weighted/dynamic step-ups:</b> The step-up is a great all-around exercise that you can do almost anywhere.

Many athletes jump rope to get the blood flowing and warm up the muscles.</li>   <li><b>Do several slow, controlled toe raises</b> to prepare the feet and ankles for jumping and landing.</li>   <li><b>Work your way up to a full vertical jump,</b>by doing box jumps and squat jumps first.</li> </ul><br>  <h2>Hone Your Vertical Jump</h2><br> When finally working on the vertical jump, be sure to start with the feet hips-distance apart. If measuring your jump height, stand about a foot away from the measuring tape (with the tape or measuring bar on your side).<br><br> <ul type=\"circle\">   <li><b>Do a warm up arm swing before the jump.</b> That is, start with arms overhead, swing the arms behind the hips as you drop into a squat then swing back up to the starting position before going right into another drop/swing for the full jump. This \"pre-swing\" helps to build momentum.</li>   <li><b>Your hips do not stay level when you measure your jump.</b>The hip closest to the measuring tip will lift to allow you to fully extend the arm on that side to reach as high as possible.</li>   <li><b>Be sure to land with the knees bent</b>to minimize the impact.</li> </ul>', 'post_cover6.jpg'),
